# File Editor
This is a personal project of mine.

It is a line by line text editor written in C based off Edlin Dos text editor.

I added in a batch script and a makefile to make the compile process a little easier
Usage:
./azr filename

l: - lists the file's contents

q: - quits

a: append mode

w: write to file
